<a name="overview"></a><h5>Overview</h5>
<p>This is TARDis, which is a rapid scorm course authoring environment. You write courses without having to muck about
with HTML or JavaScript or CSS (in fact, <i>you can't</i>). The courses are plain text in which commands telling
the player how to render the page are dropped. There's a <a href="commands.html">whole lot</a> of commands which offer
a lot of functionality.</p>
<p>This tool is written with the Chrome browser in mind, so use that. Most of it will work in Firefox, and it's never
been tested in Internet Explorer and will never be. If you run into problems, there's a little orange bug on the black
toolbar at the top which opens the helpdesk (Buggr). See <a href="#bugs">bug reporting</a> for more on how to use that.</p>
<p>Most bits of the screen will either have mouse-over text to describe what that button or area does, or have question
mark icons to click. Most icons or colourful boxes are clickable.</p>

<a name="login"></a><h5>Logging on</h5>
<p>You need to log on to use this tool. You can edit your details by clicking on your name in the top right
once you have logged on. The email address is used to send notifications from the bug reporter and todo list tools.</p>
<p>You will need a windows password to access the course share on the server (\\SERVER\Courses), which might be different
to the password that you use to log onto the server. You shouldn't need to access the courses folder in most
circumstances.</p>
<p>Logging on may also restrict the courses that you can see or edit, or limit certain functionality.</p>
<p>You can't log out directly; you have to close all browser windows and courses. You also have to do this if you get your password wrong!</p>

<a name="index"></a><h5>Course listing page</h5>
<p>The course listing page contains a list of the current courses filtered down to the settings you see in the box
at the top. This filter remembers your selection forever (even after closing browsers), so you will probably only change
it occasionally.</p>
<p>The buttons next to the filter box decide whether you want to match courses that match 'any' of the selected filter,
or match 'all' of the selected options. Some combinations will return no results. The default is 'any'.</p>
<p>Mouse over most buttons or coloured areas for tool-tips to let you know what actions are.</p>
<p>Some of the links or buttons (like this one) will bring up menus or popup screens (like this overlay). You can generally
close these either by clicking somewhere else, or using the little X icon to the top-right on windows.</p>


<a name="courses"></a><h5>Creating courses</h5>
<p>Click the New Course button at the top. This makes a generic course using the CourseSuite layout template. You can also use the button splitter
to bring down a special menu that lets you upload existing courses. The accepted format for these are either BMJ XML files, or LEO'S TOOL zip files.</p>

<a name="edit"></a><h5>Editing overview</h5>
<p>To edit a course, simply gfhziobhaufiobhviuaebhvizbhfjk xbchbukzdfbguv zbvzhu bfdhgrbvy b vsd t79ujery 79hubdfgzhyihbj dfnz habehr.</p>
<p>Easy, isn't it?</p>

<a name="bugs"></a><h5>Bug reporting</h5>
<p>If you get an error, click on the Report a bug button. Take a screenshot of the error and paste it in where mentioned on that screen. You should get
an email back about the ticket once it's been updated.</p>

<a name="todos"></a><h5>Todo lists</h5>
<p>This is an idea storage area more than a bug logger. You can put notes about courses or about the system in general into this area, and tick them
off at a later date.</p>

<a name="admin"></a><h5>Administrative functions</h5>
<p>There are none.</p>
